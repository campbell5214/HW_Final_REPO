## Quick Start To run the Project:

pip install -r requirements.txt

run python hw2.py under HW_elbow_kmeans

## Which K works the best?

Using the KElbowVisualizer, I found that the optimal K value is 4.

## The Best K Accuracy
The calculated accuracy for K=4, based on cluster-label matching, is 100%.
